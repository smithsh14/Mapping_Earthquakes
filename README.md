# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes using JS &amp; APIs

# Overview of the Project

Basil and Sadhana like how we created the earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, as well as all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Additionally they have requested an additional map for reference.

For this project, we have three main Deliverables…

-	Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
-	Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
-	Deliverable 3: Add an additional map
-	
## Resources

-	JavaScript
-	HTML
-	USGS website for relevant earthquake data
